Notes, codes, and visualizations on rotating shallow water (RSW) theory, inertia-gravity waves, and geostrophic adjustment.

Directories contain theory, numerical verification, and numerical solution to RSW IGW problems.

To get started see Write up/Theory notes.pdf

For JHU, E\&PS Fluids II, Spring '21.

Some code is in MATLAB, some in Julia (Oceananigans for DNS, gridap for arbitrary domain modal solution).

Comments welcome!
