Notes, codes, and visualizations on rotating shallow water (RSW) theory, inertia-gravity waves (IGW), and geostrophic adjustment.

Directories contain theory, numerical verification, and numerical solution to RSW IGW problems.

To get started see Write up/Theory notes.pdf

For JHU, E\&PS Fluids II, Spring '21.

Some code is in MATLAB, some in Julia ([Oceananigans](https://clima.github.io/OceananigansDocumentation/stable/) for DNS, [gridap](https://gridap.github.io/Gridap.jl/stable/) for arbitrary domain modal solution).

Comments welcome!
